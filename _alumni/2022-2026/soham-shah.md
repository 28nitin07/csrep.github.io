## Bio

I’m Soham Shah, a B.Sc (Hons) student in Computer Science & Entrepreneurial Leadership at Ashoka University (batch 2022–2026, 3.47/4 CGPA). I’m interested in using structured research, basic financial modeling, and clear communication to support better decision-making in investing and business. I have worked on building my fundamentals through CFA L1 and the Excel Skills for Business course on Coursera, and I enjoy learning by turning messy information into simple, decision-ready narratives.

Over the last few years, I’ve gained hands-on exposure through internships in investment research, financial planning, and portfolio work. At TAKSH ASSET MANAGEMENT, I conducted sector-wide research on India’s CRDMO pharma sector—covering industry dynamics, the value chain, and competitive positioning—and distilled the work into a presentation for senior mentors. I also built bottom-up comparisons across key CRDMO players (Biocon, Divi’s Laboratories, Anthem Biosciences), analyzing revenue drivers, product/segment mix, and strategic differentiators to derive company-level insights. Beyond this, I built financial models and investment theses across US defence (stocks/ETFs) and Indian manufacturing (Seshaasai) and microfinance (CreditAccess Grameen), using peer benchmarks to support sector allocation decisions.

At VASTU HOUSING FINANCE CORPORATION, I worked in Financial Planning & Analysis by analyzing annual reports, DRHPs, and financial statements to understand industry trends, evaluate performance, and benchmark competitors. I was mentored by the CFO, which helped me connect numbers with internal strategy and become more thoughtful about identifying potential window dressing. Earlier, at AEVITAS CAPITAL, I strengthened my understanding of capital markets and created a detailed report on an HNI client’s portfolio (~14 Cr), applying knowledge of mutual funds, stocks, and bonds with a focus on the client’s risk–return–investment mindset.

On campus, I served as a Teaching Assistant at Ashoka University - InfoEdge Centre for Entrepreneurship, helping curate the course “Demystifying Investments: Private Equity & Venture Capital” under Prof. Shridhar Sethuram for 70+ students. I was also Director at Pre-Incubation - Entrepreneurship Club, where I guided 15+ student founders from idea to MVP by clarifying their target customer, market gap, and hypothesis-driven decisions. I also participated in the Wharton Global High School Investment Competition, where our team secured a Top 25 rank for an investment thesis and delivered 23% portfolio growth in the simulation.

Going forward, I want to deepen my research process, become sharper at communicating complex ideas simply, and keep learning across sectors like CRDMO pharma, manufacturing, and microfinance—ideally in roles related to investment research and private equity & venture capital.
