I pursued a B.Sc (Hons) in Computer Science at Ashoka University (Batch 2022–2026), where my coursework included Data Structures and Algorithms, Intro to Machine Learning, Symbolic Logic and Applications, and Computer Graphics. Across my internships, teaching roles, and projects, I focused on building practical systems while staying grounded in strong fundamentals.

During my internship at SPARE8, a microinvestment startup, I worked on backend development for the customer support pipeline and delivered an AI support assistant using LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation. I also helped build a scalable real-time chat platform using Node.js/Express, WebSockets, and MongoDB, and reduced token usage through vector store management and prompt engineering. Earlier, as a student intern at the Koita Centre for Digital Health, I analyzed de-identified clinical records using pandas to profile utilization and medication patterns, and contributed to insights on coverage gaps and readmission risk.

My project work includes implementing Local Temporal Anti-Aliasing in JavaScript/GLSL (ThreeJS/WebGL), building a 6-letter Wordle solver using Z3 (SAT/SMT), training a plant product image pipeline with Mask R-CNN and a custom classifier using PyTorch and CUDA, and developing a 3D modelling tool in C and Python with transformations like rotation, translation, and scaling. I also served as a Teaching Assistant for Design Practices in Computer Science and for Computer Organisation and Systems at Ashoka University, and helped organize WICSCon as Head of Logistics.

My interests sit at the intersection of machine learning, computer graphics, and systems—especially where careful representations, efficient tooling, and responsible data analysis matter. Going forward, I hope to keep building reliable software that is both technically rigorous and genuinely useful, while exploring applied AI work in areas like developer tools and digital health.
