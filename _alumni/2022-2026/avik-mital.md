I pursued a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science & Entrepreneurial Leadership at Ashoka University, graduating in 2026. My academic journey combined rigorous training in computer science with a strong emphasis on entrepreneurship, problem-solving, and real-world business applications. Over the course of my degree, I developed a solid foundation in programming, data analysis, and systems thinking, while consistently applying these skills to practical projects and organizational contexts.

My professional experience includes working as an Area Management Trainee at ITC Ltd., where I focused on optimizing wholesaler billing and strengthening distribution for Bingo Snacks. This role involved extensive fieldwork, data-driven analysis, and close collaboration with sales teams and senior leadership. I built Power BI dashboards, applied clustering techniques, and contributed to pilot schemes that delivered measurable improvements in sales, billing efficiency, and throughput. Earlier, I worked at Zomato Ltd. as an Acquisition Intern, where I onboarded over 150 restaurants across Delhi-NCR, managed junior interns, and helped design sales and commission strategies in coordination with product and backend teams.

Beyond internships, I have been actively involved at Ashoka University through leadership and team roles. As Head of the Skills Department at the Ashoka Product Management Club, I helped build internal capability in Python and product thinking, organized bootcamps, and supported peers in securing internships. I have also been a team member of the Ashoka Tennis Team, balancing academics with competitive sport.

My interests span business strategy, data-driven decision-making, product management, and sports. Looking ahead, I aim to work at the intersection of technology and business, building systems and products that are grounded in strong analytical thinking and practical impact.
