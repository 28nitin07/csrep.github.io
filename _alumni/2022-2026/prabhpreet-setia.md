I am an undergraduate student at Ashoka University pursuing a B.Sc. (Honours) in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Sociology and Anthropology. My academic journey has been shaped by a strong interest in building reliable, interpretable, and socially responsible machine learning systems. Over the course of my degree, I have focused on combining rigorous mathematical foundations with hands-on systems work in applied AI.

I have worked as a Research Intern at the Mphasis Applied AI and Tech Lab, where I developed and evaluated machine learning models for real-world, high-stakes applications. My research experience also includes collaborative work with Ashoka University and IIT Kharagpur, where I contributed to projects on predictive modeling for cancer-related mitochondrial data and model generalization using meta-learning techniques. Through this work, I gained experience in auditing data pipelines, improving evaluation protocols, and communicating technical findings to senior researchers and stakeholders. I am currently completing my undergraduate thesis on robust vision models for safety-critical applications, with a focus on adversarial robustness and certified reliability.

Beyond research, I co-founded and served as Editor-in-Chief of The Uncut Team, a registered multimedia startup. In this role, I led large, cross-functional teams, managed content strategy across digital platforms, and organized events and social impact initiatives, including national-level COVID-19 relief efforts.

My interests include AI safety, robust machine learning, computer vision, and the intersection of technology with social impact. Looking ahead, I hope to continue working in applied research roles and eventually pursue graduate studies, where I can deepen my contributions to building trustworthy AI systems.
