I am an undergraduate student at Ashoka University pursuing a B.Sc
(Hons) in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship, with a minor in
Philosophy. My academic journey has been shaped by an interest in both
technical systems and conceptual thinking, and I enjoy working at the
intersection of computation, data, and real-world problem solving.

Through my coursework and projects, I have developed skills in Python,
C++, TypeScript, LaTeX, Excel, Tableau, NextJS, and UI/UX design. I have
worked on projects involving data analysis, predictive modeling, and
AI-driven platforms. These experiences included building clustering
models to segment customers, developing regression-based engagement
predictions, and contributing to the UI/UX design of an AI-powered
financial platform. I have also built a web-based simulator for a
provably fair cryptographic dice system, which deepened my understanding
of transparency and fairness in algorithmic systems.

At Ashoka University, I have been involved in academic support roles,
including working as a teaching assistant and philosophy tutor. In these
roles, I conducted one-on-one sessions, supported course delivery,
commented on student annotations, and helped peers strengthen their
arguments and research methods.

My interests lie in cryptography, data analysis, AI systems, and the
philosophical foundations of technology. In the future, I hope to work
on systems that combine strong technical design with practical impact,
especially in areas related to security, financial technology, or
data-driven decision making.
