I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Ashoka University, where my academic training focused on combining strong technical foundations with real-world problem solving. Over the course of my education, I worked extensively with programming, data analysis, and applied machine learning, while also engaging deeply with interdisciplinary projects that connected technology, policy, and social impact.

My professional experiences span consulting, product management, and applied research. I worked as an Associate Consultant Intern at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), where I consulted the Madhya Pradesh government on improving school operations through strategic and technology-led solutions. This included co-developing a management information system for school stakeholders and designing a vocational admissions framework to improve placement outcomes at scale. At Swiggy, as part of the Tech Management Intern team, I worked on cloud computing and microservices strategy and helped conceptualize a gamified application feature that improved user engagement. I also gained hands-on product experience at Kindlife, where I contributed to the development of a new sexual wellness category by analyzing market trends and customer feedback.

Alongside industry experience, I have been involved in research and leadership roles. I conducted media analysis research under Prof. Anirban Sen, analyzing over 50,000 articles using machine learning and large language models to generate interactive topic graphs. I founded a blockchain-powered NGO accelerator focused on improving collaboration and transparency in the social sector. At Ashoka University, I served as Squash Team Captain and contributed to technical initiatives with the Ministry of Technology.

My interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, product strategy, and social impact. Going forward, I aspire to build and apply technology-driven solutions that address complex societal challenges while remaining grounded in ethical and inclusive design.
