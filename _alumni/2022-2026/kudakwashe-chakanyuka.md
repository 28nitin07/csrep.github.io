I am an undergraduate student at Ashoka University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship. My academic journey has been shaped by an interest in building systems that are both technically sound and accessible to users, particularly at the intersection of Human–Computer Interaction, cybersecurity, and applied analytics. I am especially drawn to work that translates complex technical concepts into intuitive, real-world solutions.

Through my experiences, I have worked across business development, data infrastructure, SEO engineering, and analytics-focused roles. At Growdea Technologies Pvt. Ltd and Inspirit AI, I contributed to translating business development goals into technical SEO improvements, performing keyword and competitor analysis, and delivering data-driven recommendations to support scalable growth. My work has involved refining website structure and metadata, strengthening online visibility, and collaborating closely with cross-functional marketing and business teams.

I have also gained experience in data infrastructure and automation through Project Apnapan, where I built automated workflows using Python and SQL to simplify data collection, cleaning, and reporting for education-sector insights. These efforts reduced manual reporting time and improved analytical clarity for stakeholders. In research-oriented externships with Extern, Ignite XL, and Credera, I worked on SEO analytics workflows, startup evaluation using market and financial data, and DE&I research that informed the creation of digital resources for inclusive workplace practices.

Within Ashoka University, I have served as a Teaching Assistant for courses in Rethinking Development and Sustainability and Environmental Studies, and as a Resident Assistant supporting student communities. I have also worked as a Student Systems Administrator Intern, contributing to centralized authentication and secure provisioning across lab systems.

My technical skill set includes programming in Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, and Django; experience with formal verification tools such as Dafny and Tamarin Prover; and proficiency in data analysis and visualization tools including SQL, Tableau, Power BI, KNIME, SEMrush, and Google Search Console. I am interested in continuing to explore how HCI principles can improve security, privacy, and data-driven systems, and I hope to pursue opportunities that allow me to combine research, engineering, and user-centered design in meaningful ways.
