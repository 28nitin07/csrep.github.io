I completed a B.Sc (4 year) in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University, with a minor in Sociology/Anthropology. Across my coursework and internships, I gravitated toward applied data work—using analysis to make complex, real-world decisions clearer, whether in policy, social impact, or operations.

My experience spans research and analytics roles across diverse organizations. At ASHOKA CENTRE FOR A PEOPLE-CENTRIC ENERGY TRANSITION, I supported data-driven work on clean-energy technologies, including building datasets and a web application (CellSelect) to compare battery technology options. I also worked at KOITA CENTRE FOR DIGITAL HEALTH - ASHOKA, where I analyzed large-scale ICU records and related medical datasets using Python and SQL to surface gaps in access and utilization, and contributed to a policy brief. At LANCERS RISK CONSULTING, I helped synthesize multi-source risk signals to inform data center site feasibility, and at FOURTHWAVEFOUNDATION, I built dashboards and evaluation analyses to support program scale and funding outcomes.

Alongside internships, I’ve taken on leadership and community-building roles as Founder of Friday Night Run Club and President of Caperature. I’m also building a capstone project on Document Analytics using an agentic framework, aimed at turning unstructured reports into actionable datasets. My core skills include Python, SQL, machine learning, NLP, prompt engineering, and strong spreadsheet-driven analysis. I’m interested in roles where I can combine data, product thinking, and careful research to deliver practical, measurable impact—especially in climate-tech, healthcare, and evidence-based policy work.
