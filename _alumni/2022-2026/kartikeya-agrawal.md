I am a final-year undergraduate student at Ashoka University, reading for a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science with a concentration in Entrepreneurial Leadership and Strategy. My academic journey has been driven by a fascination with the intersection of rigorous mathematical theory and practical software engineering. I have immersed myself in advanced coursework ranging from Reinforcement Learning and Numerical Algorithms to Linear Algebra and Statistical Inference, building a strong foundation for tackling complex computational problems.

In my professional experience, I have had the opportunity to apply these skills to build scalable, high-impact systems. During my time as an AI Associate at Aether AI, I architected a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to handle distributed data streams and engineered a production-grade full-stack Voice AI assistant using Next.js and Streamlit. Prior to that, as a Data Engineering Intern at Rays Power Infra, I worked on orchestrating automated data synchronization pipelines between Google BigQuery and SAP ERP systems, which significantly reduced manual processing time. I also served as the Head of Quantitative Research at the Ashoka Tech Consulting Group, where I led a team in developing and back-testing algorithmic trading strategies for Nifty500 equities.

My technical interests are deeply rooted in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Quantitative Finance. I am proficient in languages such as Python, C++, and Java, and I have extensive experience with frameworks like PyTorch, FastAPI, and Docker. I enjoy working on challenging projects, such as developing "PMLM," an emotion detection model using DistilBERT, and designing a Rainbow DQN agent for stock trading. As I look toward the future, I aspire to continue engineering robust AI solutions that solve meaningful real-world problems while constantly expanding my technical and leadership capabilities.
