I am Anagha Bhavsar, a BSc (Hons) Computer Science student at Ashoka University (Minor in Psychology), currently in the 2022–2026 batch. My academic interests sit at the intersection of computational neuroscience, machine learning, and the psychology of belief formation. Through coursework and research projects, I have been exploring how neural dynamics and network-level activity can be leveraged to better understand behaviour and design grounded behavioural interventions.

A major focus of my work has been modelling belief dynamics under uncertainty, where I combined Hopfield networks and Kuramoto oscillators to study stability and switching in attractor-based memory systems. Alongside this, I have worked on the psychological underpinnings of misinformation perception, building experimental pipelines and training multi-label NLP classifiers to identify mechanisms that make misleading content believable. I have also analysed large-scale fMRI datasets through Hidden Markov Models during Neuromatch Academy to investigate latent brain states across cognitive tasks.

Professionally, I completed a research internship at the Computational Neuroscience Lab, IIT Madras, where I developed an oscillator-based convolutional autoencoder for video reconstruction and conducted detailed neuron selectivity analyses. My broader experience includes applied work at Amcogen Alliance and foundational exposure to clinical psychology at Fortis Healthcare Limited.

My technical strengths include Python, PyTorch, statistical inference, transformer-based NLP, and neural data analysis. Going forward, I hope to pursue graduate studies in Computational Neuroscience and contribute to research that connects neural activity patterns with real-world challenges in cognition, misinformation, and behavioural change.
