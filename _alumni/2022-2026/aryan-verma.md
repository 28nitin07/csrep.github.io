I am currently an undergraduate student at Ashoka University pursuing a B.Sc. (Honours) in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship, with a minor in Economics. My academic journey has been shaped by an interest in applying computational and analytical tools to real-world business and financial problems. Through coursework such as Business Applications of Data Science, Machine Learning, Quantitative Finance, Econometrics, and Business Analysis and Strategy, I have developed a strong foundation in data-driven decision-making and analytical reasoning.

Alongside academics, I have gained hands-on experience through internships across finance, consulting, and marketing. At FORVIS MAZARS, I worked as a Deal Advisory Intern where I conducted sector research across multiple industries, analyzed financial statements, and supported valuation and due diligence processes through structured Excel frameworks. At Max Life Insurance Company Limited, I contributed to investment compliance monitoring for large-scale AUM portfolios, building dashboards and identifying regulatory risks. Earlier, at Havas Media, I supported brand planning for Pokerbazzi’s digital campaigns by analyzing competitor positioning and audience insights.

My technical skill set includes Python, SQL, data analytics, machine learning, Power BI, financial modeling, and natural language processing. I have applied these skills across several academic projects, including predictive modeling for quick commerce optimization, equity valuation using DCF frameworks, recipe extraction from cooking videos using NLP pipelines, and machine learning-based sports outcome prediction.

Beyond academics and internships, I have been deeply involved in sports, serving as the Baseball Captain for Team India and leading teams at national and international levels. My interests lie at the intersection of technology, finance, and strategy, and I aspire to build a career where I can use analytical tools to solve complex business problems while continuing to learn and grow.
