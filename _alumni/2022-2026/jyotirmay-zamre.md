I am an undergraduate student at Ashoka University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. My academic journey began in 2022 and has been shaped by a strong interest in building reliable software systems and applying data-driven techniques to real-world problems. Through coursework and hands-on projects, I have developed a solid foundation in web development, system design, and software, while continuously learning how theory translates into practice.

I have worked as a Software Engineering Intern at the Mphasis AI and Applied Tech Lab at Ashoka University, where I contributed to the Multimodal Food Computing Project under Professors Lipika Dey and Partha Pratim Das. My work involved engineering a semantic search engine over the FKG.in dataset using text embeddings and Typesense, as well as building an interactive frontend with instantsearch.js and TypeScript to make complex food data intuitive to explore. I also containerized the full-stack system using Docker Compose and implemented a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to improve deployment reliability.

Previously, I interned at U4RAD Technologies PLC, Gurgaon, where I helped develop a DICOM image viewer using cornerstone.js and worked on deploying a PACS server using Docker and AWS. This role gave me exposure to production systems, automation using Lua, PowerShell, and Bash, and the importance of clear documentation and collaboration in engineering teams.

Alongside industry experience, I serve as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant at Ashoka University, supporting courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Design Practices in Computer Science, and Programming Languages and Translation. I have also been involved in student life as the Captain of the Men’s Basketball Team, balancing academics with teamwork and leadership.

My technical interests include web development, machine learning, and data-intensive systems. Looking ahead, I hope to continue working at the intersection of software engineering and applied data science, building systems that are both robust and meaningful.
