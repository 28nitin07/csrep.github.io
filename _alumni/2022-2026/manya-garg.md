I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Ashoka University pursuing a B.Sc. (Honours with Research), with minors in Psychology and Mathematics. My academic interests lie at the intersection of cryptography, networks, and machine learning, and I am particularly drawn to problems in information security and privacy-preserving systems. Through my coursework in Information Security, Information and Coding Theory, Operating Systems, Computer Vision, and Algebra, I have developed a strong theoretical foundation alongside practical systems experience.

My research journey has been shaped by hands-on work across multiple labs and collaborations. As a Summer Research Intern, I worked on implementing and benchmarking Private Set Intersection protocols, including communication-efficient OT-based PSI and Merkle-based PSI, under the guidance of Professor Debayan Gupta. In parallel, I am pursuing independent research for my undergraduate thesis on end-to-end encrypted systems, focusing on achieving tree unlinkability without reverting to star-like topologies, as well as extending Professor Arpita Patra’s work on AVABA from semi-honest to malicious security. Outside cryptography, I have also worked as a Research Assistant at the Neuroethology Lab, where I analysed zebrafish trajectory data for rationality experiments using R.

Beyond research, I have gained applied experience through my role at the Koita Centre for Digital Health, where I help develop backend infrastructure for an accessible, clinician-free autism diagnostic platform in collaboration with AIIMS Nagpur. I have also worked as a Research Analyst at the Future of Work Lab, UC Berkeley, and was recognized as an “Exceptional” data collector for my qualitative research contributions. Teaching has been an important part of my academic growth, and I have served as a Teaching Assistant for courses including Python for Research in Life Sciences, Symbolic Logic, and Information Security at Ashoka University.

In leadership and community roles, I currently serve as President of the Computer Science Society at Ashoka University and am involved with AU Women in STEM and the Women in Computing Society, where I have worked on mentorship, advocacy, and community-building initiatives. Looking ahead, I hope to continue working on secure and privacy-aware systems research, bridging theory with real-world impact.
