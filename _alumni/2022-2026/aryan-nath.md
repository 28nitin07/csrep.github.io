I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Ashoka University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science (Honours) with a minor in Mathematics. My academic interests lie at the intersection of cryptography, privacy-preserving systems, and real-world security applications. Over the course of my undergraduate journey, I have focused on building a strong theoretical foundation while also engaging deeply with hands-on research and systems-oriented work.

My undergraduate capstone thesis explores privacy-preserving, age-based proofs for Aadhaar QR codes with post-quantum security. In this work, I design and implement R1CS circuits for an incremental version of the Falcon signature scheme, integrating them into step functions for efficient proof generation. Alongside my capstone, I have conducted research as a Research Intern at Trust Lab, IIT Bombay, where I worked on incrementally verifiable computation for post-quantum signature verification using lattice-based folding schemes. At Ashoka University, I have also been part of the Automotive Security Lab, studying vehicle intrusion detection systems, replay attacks on remote keyless entry systems, and anomaly detection using RF fingerprinting. I have also engaged with research in machine learning and data science and have been published at an International level conference.

My technical skill set includes Python, C/C++, Rust, and JavaScript, along with experience using tools such as Arkworks, Circom, Bellpepper, Git, and PyTorch. I am particularly interested in applied cryptography, private set intersection protocols, zero-knowledge proofs, and post-quantum secure systems that can be deployed in practice.

Beyond research, I have served as a Teaching Assistant for courses including Discrete Mathematics, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Computer Networks at Ashoka University and have been an assistant for the course on Circom taught at the ACM Summer School on Cryptography at IIT Bombay. I have also served as the Computer Science Student Representative at Ashoka University and as the President of the Computer Science Society. Looking ahead, I hope to continue working on cryptographic systems research, with a focus on building secure, privacy-preserving infrastructure grounded in rigorous theory and careful implementation.

After completing my master’s, I intend to pursue a PhD in zero-knowledge proofs and applied cryptography. My professional career goals include joining industrial research labs such as Microsoft Research, IBM Research, Aztec Network, and Matter Labs, where I hope to design and develop privacy-preserving solutions to address pressing problems in data privacy.
