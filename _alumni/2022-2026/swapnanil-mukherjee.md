I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at Ashoka University, pursuing a BSc. (Hons.) in Computer Science between 2022 and 2026. My academic training has been grounded in strong theoretical foundations as well as hands-on research and applied machine learning work. Over the course of my degree, I have developed a sustained interest in understanding how intelligent systems reason, generalize, and integrate knowledge across modalities.

My primary research interests include multimodal learning, reasoning in AI, neurosymbolic methods, world models, and commonsense understanding. I have worked extensively with machine learning and deep learning tools such as PyTorch, Transformers, and related ecosystems, and I am comfortable designing data pipelines, running large-scale experiments, and evaluating models rigorously. My skills span programming in Python, C, Java, and SQL, along with experience using modern ML tooling for experimentation, visualization, and deployment.

I have been fortunate to work with several research and industry organizations. At Precog Lab, IIIT Hyderabad, I am a Research Intern exploring modality bias and preference in multimodal large language models, where I am leading efforts to design benchmarks for omni-modal reasoning. Previously, at SarvamAI, I worked as an ML Engineer Intern and developed early prototypes for multilingual document text recognition systems across multiple Indic languages. I have also worked with the Koita Centre for Digital Health - Ashoka on machine learning-based forecasting of critical antiretroviral therapy drugs for national-scale public health planning.

Beyond formal work, I am deeply interested in research-driven problem solving and building systems that are transparent, efficient, and grounded. Going forward, I aim to continue pursuing research at the intersection of machine learning, reasoning, and real-world impact, with a long-term goal of contributing to robust and interpretable AI systems.
