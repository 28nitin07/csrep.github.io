I am an undergraduate student at Ashoka University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Entrepreneurship, with a concentration in Mathematics. I joined Ashoka in September 2022 and expect to graduate in May 2026. My academic interests sit at the intersection of computer science, applied mathematics, and real-world problem solving, particularly in domains where technology must operate under strict reliability, scalability, and compliance constraints.

Professionally, I am the CTO and Co-Founder of CoralEHR, where I work on building an AI-native electronic health record platform for private pay and out-of-network behavioral health clinicians. My role involves designing and implementing a production-grade, HIPAA-compliant serverless infrastructure on AWS, working extensively with HealthLake and FHIR R4 standards, and translating clinician feedback from interviews into concrete system and workflow improvements. This experience has shaped my interest in building robust, auditable systems that operate in sensitive, regulated environments.

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Time Rewards, where I built end-to-end ML pipelines for billable hours forecasting using AWS Glue, Lambda, and PySpark, and evaluated multiple time series models under real-world cost and latency constraints. I have also interned at NUVAMA Wealth (Edelweiss Group), contributing to real-time event alerting systems, observability tooling, and compliance-oriented instrumentation for large-scale financial platforms.

My technical interests include machine learning, generative AI, distributed systems, and decision intelligence, with a growing focus on healthcare and financial applications. Looking ahead, I aim to continue working on technology-driven ventures that combine strong engineering foundations with meaningful real-world impact.
