I am currently pursuing a B.Sc (Hons) in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University, expecting to graduate in 2026. My academic journey has been shaped by a strong interest in the intersection of finance and technology, with coursework in Financial Modelling & Valuation, Private Equity & Venture Capital, Quantitative Finance, and Business Analysis & Strategy.

My professional experience spans multiple internships in investment banking and financial services. I have worked with Ambit as an Investment Banking Trainee in the Pharma & Healthcare division, where I pitched for fundraises, conducted comparable transaction analysis, and initiated live deal origination. At PwC India, I analyzed private credit funds and mapped refinancing opportunities, contributing to optimized debt structures for clients. I also gained valuable experience at The Supreme Industries Ltd., Ernst & Young LLP, and Aneco Industries, where I developed skills in financial analysis, market research, and cross-border M&A transactions.

My technical proficiency includes financial modelling, DCF valuation, due diligence, deal execution, and Bloomberg Terminal usage, alongside strong capabilities in MS Excel, PowerPoint, and structured problem solving. I have also been working on applying machine learning to investment banking, developing my capstone project on implementing ML primitives for deal valuation.

Beyond academics and internships, I have held leadership positions as Project Lead for Strategies & Operations at the Placement Committee under the Career Development Office, Head of Externals at Ashoka Marketing Club, and contributed to AUMUN and A.S.I.A in various capacities including event management, outreach, and content creation.

My interests lie in finance, technology, and their convergence through quantitative methods and machine learning. I am passionate about understanding market dynamics, valuation methodologies, and exploring how data-driven approaches can enhance decision-making in financial services. I have also developed an interest in gender studies, particularly examining barriers and behaviors in women's participation in investing. Looking ahead, I aspire to build a career that combines analytical rigor with strategic thinking in the financial services industry, while continuing to explore innovative applications of technology in finance.
