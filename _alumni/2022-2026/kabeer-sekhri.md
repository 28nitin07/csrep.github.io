I pursued a B.Sc. (Hons) in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University, graduating in 2026 with a strong academic foundation across systems, data science, machine learning, computer vision, and information security. Alongside core computer science coursework such as Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Data Structures, and Design and Analysis of Algorithms, I completed interdisciplinary electives focused on business applications of data science and AI-driven entrepreneurship.

My academic and professional experiences have consistently revolved around building practical, scalable technical solutions. During my time as an AI Research and Founder’s Office Intern at One Thing Design, I worked on automating LinkedIn-based lead generation processes using Python and Selenium. I developed multiple automation bots capable of handling connection requests, messaging, profile evaluation, and scraping, significantly reducing manual effort while enabling large-scale profile analysis. This experience strengthened my interest in agentic AI systems and workflow automation.

Earlier, I worked as a Research Intern at TerraPay, where I conducted structured research on modern web architectures and security practices. I analyzed authentication and authorization mechanisms, including OAuth and OpenID, and produced comparative studies across real-world implementations. I also served as a Teaching Assistant with the Lodha Genius Program, supporting high school students in advanced mathematics courses through discussion sessions and office hours.

Beyond internships, I have completed multiple technical projects spanning AI-powered resume evaluation workflows, relational database design for crime data analysis, real-time sign language detection using computer vision, and business analytics dashboards using Tableau and Power BI. I also actively engage in digital art, 3D modeling, and video editing, blending creative expression with technical tools.

My interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, automation, and applied data systems. Going forward, I aim to build intelligent, human-centered tools that combine strong engineering with thoughtful design, while continuing to explore entrepreneurial pathways in technology.
