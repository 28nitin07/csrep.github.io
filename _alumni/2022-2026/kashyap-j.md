I am a student at Ashoka University pursuing a B.Sc (Hons) in Philosophy
and Computer Science, with a strong interest in how technology and ideas
intersect to create meaningful impact. My academic journey has included
courses in Machine Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer
Graphics, Linear Algebra, and Natural Language Processing, which have
helped me build both analytical and technical foundations. Alongside
academics, I have tried to stay involved in practical projects and
student initiatives that let me apply what I learn.

I have had the opportunity to intern with Tata Sons as a Corporate Brand
Intern, with India Wants To Know Quiz as a Research and Content Intern,
and with ABC Consultants as a Marketing and Value Addition Intern.
Through these roles, I worked on content research, digital strategy,
stakeholder engagement, and campaign planning. I also worked on
partnerships and event operations, and learned how careful planning and
collaboration can significantly increase reach and engagement.

On campus, I have been a Teaching Assistant in the Philosophy
Department, supporting a Symbolic Logic course, and I have held
leadership roles such as Co-Director of Marketing and PR at IEEE Ashoka
Student Branch and Co-Editor (Games) at The Edict. These experiences
taught me teamwork, communication, and consistency. I have also built
small products and projects like UniQR, Cricket Tic-Tac-Toe, Sportlight,
and Ashoka Connections, which allowed me to explore web development and
community building.

My interests include sports storytelling, quizzing, UI/UX design, and
building technology that is useful for student and community spaces. In
the future, I hope to keep learning, build thoughtful tech products, and
work on projects that combine creativity, logic, and social impact. I am
still exploring my path, and I value every opportunity to learn from
people and experiences around me.
