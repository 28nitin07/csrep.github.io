I pursued a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Mathematics and Computer Science at Ashoka University, where my academic training combined rigorous mathematical foundations with applied computer science. My coursework included Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Machine Learning, and Data Science, which collectively shaped my interest in building data-driven systems and intelligent applications. I completed my degree with a strong academic record and a focus on applying theory to real-world problems.

Over the course of my undergraduate years, I worked across a range of academic and industry settings. I was a Research Intern at IIT Delhi, where I worked under Prof. Maya Ramanath to survey and benchmark retrieval-augmented generation models. This involved designing a modular retrieval pipeline, experimenting with different embedding and indexing strategies, and evaluating models using metrics such as recall@k, latency, and GPU utilization. I also interned at Neysa – AI Acceleration Cloud System, where I contributed to internal machine learning infrastructure, including extending red-teaming frameworks for large language models and benchmarking attacker–judge configurations to improve robustness and efficiency.

At Ashoka University’s Centre for Data Science and Analytics, I worked as a Software Intern, where I designed data ingestion pipelines using the World Bank API and built interfaces to improve dataset discovery and reliability. In addition, I gained applied industry experience as a Tech Intern at Retransform – Real Estate, working on fraud detection tasks using large-scale transactional datasets and ensemble machine learning methods.

Beyond internships, I have been involved in several project-based initiatives, including an agentic AI platform for automated exploratory and predictive analytics, a collaborative real-time text editor, and an air quality index prediction system using deep learning models. I have also served as a Teaching Assistant for Data Structures and Algorithms at Ashoka University, supporting students through office hours, grading, and concept clarification.

My interests lie in artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, and data science, particularly in building robust, scalable systems that bridge research and practice. Going forward, I aspire to continue working at the intersection of research and applied engineering, contributing to impactful AI-driven systems while deepening my understanding of advanced machine learning methods.
