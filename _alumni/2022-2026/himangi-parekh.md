I am a final-year undergraduate student pursuing a B.Sc. (Hons) in Computer Science at Ashoka University, with a strong academic and practical focus on finance, data science, and applied technology. Alongside my major, I have completed the CFA Level I examination and pursued advanced coursework in finance and data science through academic programs at Monash University and Stanford University. These experiences have helped me build a rigorous analytical foundation while exposing me to global academic and professional environments.

My professional journey spans strategy consulting, investment banking, private credit, and early-stage startups. I have worked with organizations such as EY Parthenon, Ernst & Young (EY), Rungta Advisors, and ASK Asset & Wealth Management, where I supported market entry strategies, financial valuation models, cross-border M&A analysis, and private credit investment evaluations. Across these roles, I have built DCF and comparable company models, contributed to client-facing pitch decks and placement memorandums, and analyzed sector-specific data to support investment and strategic decisions.

I have also worked in early-stage technology environments, including LEO, a Silicon Valley-based med-tech startup, where I engaged with doctors to assess product usability and adoption potential, and contributed to investor pitches and market sizing. My technical interests extend into research, where I have worked on AI and NLP projects at IIT Kharagpur, focusing on healthcare applications of large language models and unstructured data.

Beyond internships and research, I have been actively involved in leadership and student organizations at Ashoka University. I have served as Vice President of the Ashoka Women in Finance Society, Head of Events and Logistics at IEEE Ashoka, and Founder and Head of Outreach at the Computer Science Society of Ashoka, leading teams, organizing large-scale events, and building student communities.

My interests lie at the intersection of finance, technology, and real-world impact—particularly in fintech, private credit, healthcare technology, and AI-driven decision systems. Going forward, I aim to build or work with mission-driven organizations that apply technology and financial thinking to solve complex problems in emerging markets.
