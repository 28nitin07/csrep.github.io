I pursued a B.Sc. (Hons) in Computer Science and Entrepreneurial Leadership at Ashoka University, with a minor in Mathematics. My academic journey focused on building strong computational foundations while also engaging deeply with problem solving, systems thinking, and applied analysis. Alongside core coursework in data structures, algorithms, and computer organization, I developed an interest in using technology to address real-world challenges through structured and analytical approaches.

My professional experiences span consulting, research, and technology-driven roles. I worked as an Associate Consultant Intern at Bain & Company, where I contributed to streamlining state-wise logistics and operational processes for a beverage company. This experience strengthened my understanding of data-backed decision-making, operational efficiency, and stakeholder collaboration. I also interned at Dalberg Advisors, where I was exposed to impact-focused consulting work and analytical problem solving in development contexts. At Ernst & Young (EY), I worked within the Tax Technology team, automating accounting data transformations using Python and Excel, and collaborating closely with consultants and developers to ensure accuracy and usability.

On the academic side, I served as a Research Intern at Ashoka University, where I applied Large Language Models to topic recommendation and thematic analysis. Working with Professor Anirban Sen, I helped analyze and visualize topic structures generated by LLMs, building interactive maps that allowed users to explore relationships between themes and keywords.

Beyond academics and internships, I held leadership roles within student organizations, including serving as Vice President of the Computer Science Society and leading strategy and operations for the Orator’s Club. My interests include technology for social impact, data-driven problem solving, and education. Going forward, I aspire to work at the intersection of technology, research, and impact-oriented problem solving, building solutions that are both technically sound and socially meaningful.
