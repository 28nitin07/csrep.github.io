I am a final-year undergraduate student pursuing a B.Sc. (Hons) in Computer Science with a minor in Economics at Ashoka University. My academic training has given me a strong foundation in mathematics, algorithms, and systems, with coursework spanning multivariable calculus, linear algebra, numerical optimization, and natural language processing. Through these experiences, I have developed a steady interest in building data-driven systems that are both theoretically grounded and practically deployable.

Over the course of my undergraduate journey, I have worked across research labs, startups, and academic settings. I have been associated with organizations such as Mphasis Lab, MetaString Foundation, Koita Center for Digital Health at Ashoka, Nurix AI, and Plutos One, where I contributed to projects involving machine learning, large-scale data processing, and applied AI systems. My work has ranged from designing ETL pipelines and deploying machine learning models as microservices to building retrieval-augmented generation systems and conducting applied research in healthcare and biomedical data. I have also served as a Teaching Assistant for multiple computer science courses at Ashoka University, supporting instruction in areas such as natural language processing, computational geometry, and data structures.

My technical skill set includes Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, SQL, AWS, API development, data engineering, and statistical data analysis. I am particularly interested in natural language processing, machine learning systems, and interdisciplinary research that connects computation with real-world domains such as health and society.

Beyond academics, I am actively involved in chess and have represented Ashoka University as Vice Captain of the Ashoka Chess Team. Looking ahead, I aim to continue working at the intersection of machine learning research and scalable systems, with the long-term goal of contributing to impactful, socially relevant technology.
