I am currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Science at Ashoka University, where my work focuses on accessibility in computing, computer vision, and human-centered technology design. Over the past few years, I have explored how technical systems can be built to serve real-world needs, especially for visually impaired users. My academic journey has been shaped by coursework in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Trustworthy AI, and Design Practices in CS, alongside hands-on prototyping and research.

Through projects such as NVDAI and *Join the Dots*, I have worked on AI-powered accessibility tools that aim to make visually heavy digital and classroom content more inclusive. My experience spans software development, OpenCV-based vision systems, machine learning integration, and rapid prototyping using microcontrollers and hardware tools. I have also contributed to accessibility research through curriculum design and published work in ACM COMPUTE’25.

Beyond projects, I have worked with organizations including I-STEM, University of Michigan, Mphasis Ashoka Digital Makerspace, and Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. As President of the Women in Computing Society Ashoka University, I helped organize a national accessibility and inclusivity technology conference and led initiatives to strengthen the CS community on campus.

I am particularly interested in assistive technology, frugal innovation, and building systems that bridge research and deployment. Going forward, I hope to continue working at the intersection of accessibility, AI, and education, designing tools that make complex technical knowledge more equitable and widely accessible.
