I completed my B.Sc. (4-year) degree in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University (Class of 2026), building a strong foundation in both technical problem-solving and business thinking. My coursework included Theory of Computation, Data Structures, Intro to Machine Learning, Calculus, and Linear Algebra, which helped me develop structured reasoning across computer science and applied mathematics.

Professionally, I have worked across business development and AI engineering roles. As a Business Development Intern at Growth Engine Pvt. Ltd., I supported industry and opportunity analysis for capital deployment across aerospace, defence, automotive, and EV sectors. This involved structured outreach with entrepreneurs, consultants, and domain experts, as well as evaluating joint venture opportunities and feasibility. Through these engagements, I gained practical exposure to tendering processes, indigenisation requirements, and defence-sector roadmaps, while also learning how client conversations shape investment and execution decisions.

During my AI Engineering Internship at MAI, I worked on building applied AI solutions for real-world media and education use cases. I contributed to a proof-of-concept RAG-based chatbot for an ed-tech client, using OCR and machine learning techniques to process text, equations, and visual content for better retrieval and student support. I also helped streamline data processing for election coverage and built automation pipelines for transcription, subtitles, and content scaling across 50+ media episodes. My interests sit at the intersection of machine learning, automation, and product execution, and I hope to continue building AI systems that are reliable, scalable, and directly useful in production environments.
