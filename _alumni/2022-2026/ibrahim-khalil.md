## Personal Bio

I pursued a Bachelor of Science (four-year program) in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University, graduating in 2026 with a strong academic foundation and interdisciplinary exposure. During my time at Ashoka, I completed coursework across computer science, economics, political science, and entrepreneurship, including subjects such as machine learning, data structures, econometrics, political economy, and media analysis. This academic journey helped me develop a balanced perspective on how technology, policy, and society interact.

My core skills include Python, JavaScript, Node.js, machine learning, data analysis, RESTful API development, cloud technologies, and product management. I worked extensively with tools such as Git, AWS, Stata, MongoDB, and Linux, and applied these skills across research, development, and leadership roles. I am particularly interested in building scalable systems and using data-driven methods to solve real-world problems.

I gained professional experience across diverse organizations, including OUTTHINK, where I worked as a Product Manager and Product & Growth Fellow, leading cross-functional teams and launching cybersecurity products for enterprise users. I also worked as a Research Intern at NITI Aayog and Jan Jagran Shakti Sangathan, contributing to policy research, field studies, and grassroots development initiatives. At the Center for Economic Data and Analysis and the Centre for Translation, I developed data dashboards and large-scale search systems to improve access to multilingual resources. My early internships at organizations such as the Bombay Stock Exchange, Sequretek, and SaveLIFE Foundation helped me build strong foundations in cybersecurity, analytics, and software development.

At Ashoka University, I actively contributed to campus life through leadership roles in the Student Government and the Career Development Office. As Minister and Deputy Minister of Technology, I led multiple digital initiatives that improved student engagement and administrative efficiency. I also served as a Teaching Assistant in the Computer Science Department and as Chief Technology Officer of the Ashoka University Election Commission.

My academic and personal interests lie in computational social science, cybersecurity, machine learning, and product strategy. I enjoy working at the intersection of technology and public policy, and I am motivated by projects that have measurable social impact. In the future, I hope to continue building responsible digital systems, contribute to research-driven innovation, and work on products that improve institutional and civic processes in meaningful ways.
