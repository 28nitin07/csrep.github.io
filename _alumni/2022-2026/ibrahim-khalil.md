I am an undergraduate student at Ashoka University pursuing a four-year B.Sc. in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship, graduating in 2026. My academic journey has been shaped by coursework across computer science, economics, and design, including Data Structures, Computer Networks, Introduction to Machine Learning, Design Practices in Computer Science, Econometrics, and Creativity and Design Thinking. This interdisciplinary foundation has helped me develop a strong interest in building practical, user-centered technology products, particularly in security and infrastructure-heavy domains.

I currently work at Outthink as a Product Manager, where I lead product initiatives across real-time threat detection, phishing defense, and security behavior change. I have owned features end-to-end, from problem discovery and user research to PRDs, sprint execution, and launch. At Outthink, I shipped the company’s first production feature used by over 100 enterprise customers, built and launched PhishSignal—a real-time Chrome extension to counter phishing manipulation—and ran multiple product experiments across security UX and gamified awareness. My role involves close collaboration with engineers, designers, and QA teams, managing sprints, maintaining Jira workflows, and aligning delivery with customer needs.

Alongside this, I have held research, development, and policy-focused roles at organizations including Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd, Sequretek, Sarfaroshi Foundation, and Ashoka University. These experiences range from malware analysis and honeypot research to cybersecurity policy evaluation, socio-economic field research, and large-scale web development projects. Within Ashoka University, I have also served in student government and technical leadership roles, building platforms used by thousands of students and deploying secure digital election systems.

My interests lie at the intersection of product, cybersecurity, and human behavior. I am particularly curious about how design, incentives, and systems thinking can reduce security risk at scale. Going forward, I aim to continue building high-impact security products and developer-facing tools that solve real-world problems through thoughtful execution and strong fundamentals.
