    "content": "Vansh presented a research paper at the MobileHCI Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt     Vansh Bothra , a final-year Computer Science and Entrepreneurship student, recently attended the MobileHCI conference in Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt, to present research on inclusive e-commerce design. Held at the Park Regency Resort, the conference served as a professional forum for scholars and practitioners in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This participation provided a platform to engage with the international research community and share findings on digital accessibility.  The Research: Designing for Emergent Users  The research originated as an Independent Study Module (ISM) under the supervision of Professor Anirban Sen (Ashoka University) and Professor Dipanjan Chakraborty (BITS-Pilani Hyderabad). Vansh and co-author Amrit Singh investigated the barriers to e-commerce adoption among “emergent users” in India, specifically individuals from rural areas and elderly populations.  The mixed-method study identified that these users often face significant difficulties with product filtering and digital payment systems due to a lack of trust and unfamiliarity with standard user interface patterns. The research concluded by proposing specific design recommendations aimed at improving accessibility and building trust for these demographics.  The full paper and design recommendations are available here.  Conference Proceedings  The three-day conference featured two days of technical paper and poster presentations. Vansh presented the study’s findings to an audience of international researchers and students, participating in a constructive environment for discussing current trends in HCI.  He attended the conference alongside Professor Dipanjan Chakraborty. Engaging in academic discourse with professors and peers from various global institutions provided a broader perspective on the challenges of technology adoption—insights that significantly complement his undergraduate studies in computer science and entrepreneurship.  As part of the conference program, the organizers arranged a cultural outing to the Red Sea. This provided an opportunity to observe the local Egyptian context and the geography of the region. The visit offered a brief but insightful look into the history and environment of Sharm-El-Sheikh.                Vansh at the MobileHCI Conference venue in Sharm-El-Sheikh.                 Red Sea, Egypt       Acknowledgments  Vansh expresses his gratitude to Ashoka University for the grant that funded his travel and conference registration. He also thanks his advisors and co-author for the opportunity to contribute to this research. Presenting at an international forum during his undergraduate studies marks a significant academic milestone."

    "content": "Vaani Goenka, a Computer Science &amp; Mathematics student at Ashoka University, has been working on research in automated verification and program correctness in a pedagogical context with Prof. Thakkar from the department. Recently, their work was accepted at ACM COMPUTE, India’s largest CS pedagogy conference. She was also recently awarded the RSR Grant for Women in STEM at Ashoka.  In conventional CS education, student-authored programs and performance on test-cases are relied upon as a proxy for computational thinking. She envisions to move beyond these, with learners being provided with a better way of constructing their programs, where correctness and mathematical reasoning are prioritized. The results suggest that not only is this pedagogically feasible in Introductory CS courses, but it is also necessary for learning goals to be realigned with the foundations of computational thinking in an era of increasingly capable code generation tools.  This achievement highlights not only her technical excellence but also her commitment to advancing pedagogical engagement with the field of Computer Science, reasserting its true meaning.     “The crisis is not that AI undermines education, but that AI reveals how shallow our pedagogical proxies for understanding have been.” said Vaani.   Vaani intends to further develop her automated verification tool to support multiple programming languages and implement it at universities in India.  Congratulations, Vaani, on this incredible milestone!"

    "content": "Aryan Nath, a final-year Computer Science major and Mathematics minor at Ashoka University, recently attended the International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (PReMI 2025) to present his research on climate vulnerability assessment using explainable deep learning. Held at IIT Delhi, the conference served as a professional forum for researchers and practitioners working in pattern recognition, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. His participation provided an opportunity to engage with the international research community, present the team’s findings, and discuss the policy relevance of interpretable machine learning approaches for climate risk analysis.  From the India Conference at Harvard Hackathon  A student team comprising Soumyajit Basu, Fiona Arora, Aryan Nath, and Karan Kumar, mentored by Prof. Lipika Dey, was shortlisted as the the only student group selected to present in person at Harvard University in the data science track of the Policy Hackathon, part of the India Conference at Harvard (ICH).  Among more than a thousand participating teams - including policy professionals and domain experts - the project stood out for its ability to translate complex climate and socio-economic datasets into meaningful analytical insights.  The research focused on identifying vulnerable communities across India and proposing targeted, data-driven adaptation strategies. By combining representation learning with explainability methods, the project demonstrated how machine learning can support climate-resilient policy development.  With support from the Mphasis AI &amp; Applied Tech Lab, Fiona Arora represented the team at Harvard and presented the work before a distinguished panel of judges.                The Team                     Fiona Arora presenting the work at Harvard University       The Research: Assessing Climate Vulnerability Using Explainable Deep Clustering  The work was later expanded into a research paper titled:  “An Explainable Deep-Clustering Approach to Assess Climate Vulnerability in India.”  The approach combined:     Latent space representation using a β variational auto-encoder   Block-level clustering for fine-grained vulnerability assessment   SHAP-based interpretability to identify key contributing factors   Policy-oriented visualization and analysis   The framework addressed limitations of traditional vulnerability indices by providing localized insights and interpretable results for policymakers.  Presentation at PReMI 2025  The refined research was accepted at the International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (PReMI 2025), where Aryan Nath presented the work.  The conference brought together researchers working in applied machine learning, pattern recognition, health analytics, and artificial intelligence.  Presenting the work enabled discussions with faculty and researchers on emerging topics such as quantum artificial intelligence, soft computing, and swarm intelligence.  Poster Presentation and Technical Discussions  In addition to the oral session, the research was also presented in poster format. This created opportunities for detailed technical discussions on:     Model interpretability   Evaluation of vulnerability indices   Policy applications of explainable AI                 Poster presentation at PReMI 2025       Acknowledgments  Aryan thanks his collaborators - Soumyajit Basu, Fiona Arora, and Karan Kumar - and advisor Prof. Lipika Dey for their collaboration and support.  He also acknowledges:     India Conference at Harvard (ICH)   International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (PReMI 2025)   Mphasis AI &amp; Applied Tech Lab"
