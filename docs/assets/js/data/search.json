    "content": "Vansh presented a research paper at the MobileHCI Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt     Vansh Bothra , a final-year Computer Science and Entrepreneurship student, recently attended the MobileHCI conference in Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt, to present research on inclusive e-commerce design. Held at the Park Regency Resort, the conference served as a professional forum for scholars and practitioners in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This participation provided a platform to engage with the international research community and share findings on digital accessibility.  The Research: Designing for Emergent Users  The research originated as an Independent Study Module (ISM) under the supervision of Professor Anirban Sen (Ashoka University) and Professor Dipanjan Chakraborty (BITS-Pilani Hyderabad). Vansh and co-author Amrit Singh investigated the barriers to e-commerce adoption among “emergent users” in India, specifically individuals from rural areas and elderly populations.  The mixed-method study identified that these users often face significant difficulties with product filtering and digital payment systems due to a lack of trust and unfamiliarity with standard user interface patterns. The research concluded by proposing specific design recommendations aimed at improving accessibility and building trust for these demographics.  The full paper and design recommendations are available here.  Conference Proceedings  The three-day conference featured two days of technical paper and poster presentations. Vansh presented the study’s findings to an audience of international researchers and students, participating in a constructive environment for discussing current trends in HCI.  He attended the conference alongside Professor Dipanjan Chakraborty. Engaging in academic discourse with professors and peers from various global institutions provided a broader perspective on the challenges of technology adoption—insights that significantly complement his undergraduate studies in computer science and entrepreneurship.  As part of the conference program, the organizers arranged a cultural outing to the Red Sea. This provided an opportunity to observe the local Egyptian context and the geography of the region. The visit offered a brief but insightful look into the history and environment of Sharm-El-Sheikh.                Vansh at the MobileHCI Conference venue in Sharm-El-Sheikh.                 Red Sea, Egypt       Acknowledgments  Vansh expresses his gratitude to Ashoka University for the grant that funded his travel and conference registration. He also thanks his advisors and co-author for the opportunity to contribute to this research. Presenting at an international forum during his undergraduate studies marks a significant academic milestone."

    "content": "Vaani Goenka, a Computer Science &amp; Mathematics student at Ashoka University, has been working on research in automated verification and program correctness in a pedagogical context with Prof. Thakkar from the department. Recently, their work was accepted at ACM COMPUTE, India’s largest CS pedagogy conference. She was also recently awarded the RSR Grant for Women in STEM at Ashoka.  In conventional CS education, student-authored programs and performance on test-cases are relied upon as a proxy for computational thinking. She envisions to move beyond these, with learners being provided with a better way of constructing their programs, where correctness and mathematical reasoning are prioritized. The results suggest that not only is this pedagogically feasible in Introductory CS courses, but it is also necessary for learning goals to be realigned with the foundations of computational thinking in an era of increasingly capable code generation tools.  This achievement highlights not only her technical excellence but also her commitment to advancing pedagogical engagement with the field of Computer Science, reasserting its true meaning.     “The crisis is not that AI undermines education, but that AI reveals how shallow our pedagogical proxies for understanding have been.” said Vaani.   Vaani intends to further develop her automated verification tool to support multiple programming languages and implement it at universities in India.  Congratulations, Vaani, on this incredible milestone!"

    "content": "Roshni Agarwal, a Computer Science student at Ashoka University, has been awarded the ESET Women in Cybersecurity Scholarship, an international recognition that celebrates women excelling in cybersecurity and information technology.  The scholarship is presented by ESET, a global leader in digital security, to encourage greater representation of women in the cybersecurity field. Roshni’s project focused on developing secure communication protocols and analyzing network vulnerabilities, earning high praise from the review committee.  This achievement highlights not only her technical excellence but also her commitment to advancing digital safety and privacy.     “Receiving this scholarship reinforces my belief that cybersecurity is not just about systems, but about people — protecting their data, their identities, and their digital freedoms,” said Roshni.   Roshni plans to use the scholarship to further her research in ethical hacking and network defense. She encourages more young women to take up roles in the cybersecurity domain, emphasizing that diversity brings stronger and more innovative security solutions.  Congratulations, Roshni, on this incredible milestone!"
